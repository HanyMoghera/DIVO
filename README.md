# üéì Graduation Project: DIVO

## üí° Project Overview

DIVO is a comprehensive platform designed to provide a community-driven space for technical support, peer-to-peer assistance, and a centralized database for common technical issues. It features a robust backend API supporting user profiles, a full-featured community forum (posts, likes, comments, shares), a ticketing system for specialized support ("Help Sessions"), web scraping for product pricing, and a curated database for Windows error codes.

This project was developed as a requirement for the **Software Industry and multimedia** program.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (v14.x or later recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager)
  * **MongoDB** (Local instance or Atlas connection string)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Project Folder Name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your configuration variables. At minimum, you'll need:

    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI="[Your MongoDB Connection String]"
    JWT_SECRET="[A long, secure random string]"
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="[Your Cloud Name]"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="[Your API Key]"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="[Your API Secret]"
    # Add other variables for email service, etc.
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if using nodemon:
    npm run dev
    ```

    The API should now be running at `http://localhost:[PORT]` (default: `http://localhost:5000`).

## üîí Security & Middleware

The API implements the following security measures and middleware:

  * **`requireAuth`**: Ensures the user is logged in by validating a **JWT** in the request header. This protects most user-specific actions.
  * **`requireAdmin`**: Restricts access to administrative tasks (e.g., deleting a user, managing service shops) to users with the Admin role.
  * **`requireAdminOrSpecialist`**: Grants access to both Admin and Specialist roles for actions related to help session management.
  * **`combinedAuth`**: Middleware likely used to check for authentication across multiple user types (e.g., general user, admin, specialist).
  * **`multer`**: Used for handling **`multipart/form-data`** and uploading images/videos to Cloudinary before saving the URL to the database.
